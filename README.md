# No-show Appointment Analysis
## by James Okoro

## Dataset Description
This analysis investigates possible reasons why patients do not show up for scheduled appointments. The dataset collects information of over 110,000 medical appointments made by over 60,000 patients in Brazil. It was collected in April to June 2016 and it is focused on characteristics of patients as well as their presence or absence from scheduled medical appointments.

## Exploratory Analysis
In this section, we would make use of both single and multiple variable explorations to investigate different features and their relationship with appointment no-show. This would provide the information needed to answer the questions:
- Does the age and gender of a patient affect their attendance to appointments?
- Does scholarship from the Brazilian welfare program affect No-show?
- Does patients diagnosis affect attendance to appointments?
- Does increase in number of waiting days affect patients attendance to appointments?
- What is the relationship between Neighbourhood and their showing up for appointments?
- Does receiving SMS reminder affect patients attendance to appointments?

## Key Findings
From this analysis, we observed the following insights:
- Approximately 20% of the total patients do not show up for appointments.
- More females than males schedule appointments.
- The bulk of appointments are from the age group 18 year olds to 60 year olds while infants and seniors tend to show up for their appointments more than other age categories.
- Scholarship has no impact on patient's ability to show up for their appointments. This might be an indication that medical fees is fairly affordable.
- SMS notification has little to no impact on patient's abilty to show up as those didnâ€™t receive SMS had more chance of showing up.
- Patient with shorter waiting time tend to show-up more than those with longer waiting time. This implies that as the wait time increases probability of show up reduces.
- Age of the patient has a direct relationship on their ability to show up.

## Limitations:
This analysis is limited to the following:
- Data collection time is a bit too small to make predictions as regards patients no-show up factor (data is only for about 3 months).
- Information on proximity of each neighbourhood medical center and patients homes would be very useful in determining how patients show up for their appointments.
- More informations needs to be provided on major sickness/diseases types, in other words, the severity of the medical condition that prompt patients to book appointments
